			1.  The way get started is to quit talking and begin doing.<br>
			2.  The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty.<br>
			3.  Don’t let yesterday take up too much of today.<br>
			4.  If you are working on something that you really care about, you don’t have to be pushed. The vision pulls you.<br>
			5.  Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.<br>
			6.  Every day is a good day. There is something to learn, care and celebrate.<br>
			7.  People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.<br>
			8.  Entrepreneurs are great at dealing with uncertainty and also very good at minimizing risk. That’s the classic entrepreneur.<br>
			8.  We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated.<br>
			9.  Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Wishing is not enough; we must do.<br>
			10.  Imagine your life is perfect in every respect; what would it look like?
